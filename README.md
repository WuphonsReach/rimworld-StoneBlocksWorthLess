# rimworld-StoneBlocksWorthLess

Lower the market value of stone blocks (and things made from them).

| Material  | Orginal | Modded |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| Granite   | $0.90   | $0.20  |
| Limestone | $0.90   | $0.20  |
| Marble    | $0.90   | $0.90  |
| Sandstone | $0.90   | $0.50  |
| Slate     | $0.90   | $0.50  |
| Vacstone  | $2.00   | $2.00  |

Approximate prices per wall segment:

| Wall Material | Original | Modded  | Percentage |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Gold          | $500.00  | $500.00 | 100%       |
| Silver        | $50.50   | $50.50  | 100%       |
| Granite       | $7.90    | $4.40   | 56%        |
| Limestone     | $7.90    | $4.40   | 56%        |
| Marble        | $7.70    | $7.70   | 100%       |
| Sandstone     | $7.40    | $5.40   | 73%        |
| Slate         | $7.90    | $5.90   | 75%        |
| Vacstone      | $13.40   | $13.40  | 100%       |

The above prices are only accurate to the 1st decimal point due to only building 10x of each wall and the wealth calculation mod rounding off to the nearest whole credit.

Walls seem to have a base value of about $3.30 per segment.  Eventhe value of stone blocks decreases to zero, it can't drive the market value of a wall segment below that base value.  This mod still drives down the cost of granite and limestone walls to 56% of the original value.
